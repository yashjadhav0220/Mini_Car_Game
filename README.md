# Mini_Car_Game

In this Car game the player needs to protect his/her car from the cars coming towards the car. Every time the car dodges 2 points are allocated to the player. The game comes to an end when the player reaches 50 points. This Car game project is written in C++ language with the concepts of Object-Oriented Programming.

The program includes four main functions such as 
void car- This function is the playerâ€™s car.
void control-   This function controls the movement of the car. 
void road- This function creates the endpoints for the car so that it    cannot go out of the road.
void traffic- This function controls the other cars which are proceeding towards the player.
